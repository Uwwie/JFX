Maxi is about 50.5 inches high. She is 13. Eeh.
Famous front cat of Teshi hates, when people call her small. I''M NOT SMALL!
Despite her height (that''s huge!), Maxi won a Muay Thai School Championship.
Maxi loves junk food. It''s cheap and tasty. Why would someone pay more for food?
If Maxi dyes her hair, she does it with her tail and ears aswell.
Iva is 58.5 high.
Maxi, Tomura and Iva are of the same age.
Iva compensates for her lack of skill in one art with creativity and amount of arts she knows.
Iva''s favorite lesson is biology. She dreams to become a splendid scientist one day!
Iva looks cold, but in fact she''s a very loyal friend.
Tomura is about 57 inches high.
Tomura doesn''t need glasses. She just likes how they look.
Everyone likes to call Tomura "Tom". We all have short names, she should have a short one too!
Tomura loves more traditional outfits, while others prefer something more... fashionable.
Maxi wanted to wear a bow, but Tomura claimed it first. It would look so cute on me :(
Li is the oldest and therefore the tallest of all. Her height is 64 inches.
Li doesn''t like to study. She''s more into chatting, intrigue... She knows much even about me :(
Li''s amazing at Wing Chun, thus people try not to anger her. They still disrespect me, as if my style is nothing special!
Li''s hair isn''t actually pink. It''s a secret, don''t tell her that you know it!
Li doesn''t like, when people complain about her open outfits. She is already 16!
